Remember that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you would likely need to handle more edge cases, implement more robust error handling, and possibly include more sophisticated data cleaning and augmentation techniques."

            "{\"prompt\": \"What are the steps to How to Plant a Tree?\", \"completion\": \"1. Select a healthy tree that naturally thrives in your climate Trees live a long time so its important to pick a local species that wont struggle to survive If you arent sure which species grow locally spend some time researching trees that are native to your area1\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can also to a local nursery owner for species suggestions\\nTree roots always grow best in their native soil2\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n You shouldnt need to amend or fertilize the soil as long as the species is native and climateappropriate3\\nX\\nResearch source\\n2. Plant most tree species in the fall or early spring Cool weather is the best time for planting since the trees are dormant during that time Planting a tree in late spring or summer when the roots are actively growing puts too much stress on the tree and it may not survive4\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEarly fall is best for container trees and balled and burlapped BB trees5\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSpring is best for bare root trees trees that have been stored without any soil around their roots6\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlways plant before the first freeze or after the last freeze\\n3. Pick an open flat area away from buildings powerlines and utilities Make sure theres plenty of room for the tree to grow to maturity In the United States you can call 811 before you dig Someone will come out to mark your underground utility lines for free or walk you through it over the phone so you can avoid planting too close to them7\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMost urban communities have zoning laws about trees and digging holes To avoid fines check local laws before you plant If you live outside the city limits you can plant without restrictions\\n4. Make sure your chosen location gets at least 6 hours of sunlight daily Light needs vary depending on the tree species so youll want to check your specs That said most trees require full sun to thrive8\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n At a bare minimum full sun amounts to 6 hours of uninterrupted sunlight per day\\n5. Water the soil on planting day before you dig the hole Give the planting location a good hose down to moisten the soil and make it easier to turn Moist soil is also more hospitable and minimizes root stress for a newly transplanted tree9\\nX\\nResearch source\\n6. Dig a hole 23 times the diameter of the root ball Youll be using the original soil to fill in the hole around the root ball so shovel the excavated soil right next to the hole For easy backfilling it can help to lay down a tarp and shovel the soil on top of it10\\nX\\nTrustworthy Source\\nUniversity of Missouri Extension\\nUniversity of Missouri program dedicated to researchbased practical public education\\nGo to source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA regular shovel will work fine since youve already moistened the soil\\nYou dont need to literally measure the root ball unless you want to Just make sure the width of the hole can easily accommodate the roots\\n7. Dig the hole to the same depth as the root ball Locate the first lateral roots which are the long offshoots near the top of the root ball For proper placement the lateral roots need to be 12\\u00a0in 2551\\u00a0cm under the soils surface after planting The start of the tree trunk should be about level with the ground11\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you plant too deep the roots will struggle to get oxygen and eventually smother Water may also pool around the base of the tree causing the bark to deteriorate which eventually kills the tree12\\nX\\nResearch source\\n8. Nestle the root ball into the prepared hole Any loose soil inside the hole needs to be moved to the side so the root ball is resting on solid ground After the root ball is in position make sure the root flare the spot where the tree trunk meets the root ball is just visible above the soil line13\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the roots are wrapped in burlap cut the burlap off once the tree is properly positioned in the hole14\\nX\\nResearch source\\n9. Fill in the planting hole with the original soil and tamp lightly Loosen and break up any dirt clods before backfilling the hole Then fill in the space around the root ball and press down gently15\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAvoid tamping down the soil too hard since that compacts the soil and reduces available oxygen for the roots\\nIts important to backfill with the original soil Using soil amendments around the root ball can cause problems like root rot\\n10. Water deeply at the base of the tree until the soil is saturated Pour the water slowly so you dont disturb or compact the soil around the root ball Plenty of available moisture will help the soil settle around the roots so the tree can establish itself in its new environment\\n16\\nX\\nResearch source\\n11. Add a 34\\u00a0in 76102\\u00a0cm layer of organic wood mulch around the tree You dont have to mulch immediately after planting but try to do it fairly soon to reap the protective benefits Dont pile mulch up around the tree trunkleave a 24\\u00a0in 51102\\u00a0cm space between the trunk and the mulch17\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf youre planting in the fall mulch before the first freeze If youre planting in the spring mulch before summer\\n\\nOrganic wood mulch helps the soil retain moisture and regulate temperature It also prevents weeds from sprouting up and stealing the trees nutrients\\n12. Keep the soil consistently moist for the first 2 years Watering your tree properly helps the roots get established and is crucial to ensure the trees survival How often you water depends on your climate so monitor the soil and water as often as needed even in the winter18\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you cant monitor the soil moisture closely consider installing a drip irrigation system The system discharges small quantities of water on a regular basis directly to the root zone to keep the tree hydrated\\nIf the ground freezes in winter you dont need to water during that time\\nGive enough water to the plant to stay healthy but not too much water that its always soggy\\n13. Water less frequently once the tree is established After about 2 years you can ease up on the watering The specific amount of water needed still depends on your climate but in general water an established tree deeply every 35 days during the growing season late spring through early fall In the dormant season late fall through early spring water once a month19\\nX\\nResearch source\\n14. Remove damaged or diseased branches every few months No pruning is needed at the time of planting but be sure to check on the tree every 23 months once its in the ground Use sharp pruning shears to remove any damaged or diseased areas Always leave the lower limbs intact if possible20\\nX\\nResearch source\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIts important to limit pruning for the first 2 years until the tree is established so you dont stunt the growth\\nOnce the tree is established prune the tree according to the the needs of the species Be sure to research thoroughly so you know when and how much to prune\\nPeriodically you can add an allpurpose fertilizer depending on the soil\"}\n",
